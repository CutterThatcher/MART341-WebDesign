            <h3>About Track and Field</h3>
            <p>Track and field has a rich history dating back to ancient Greece, where it was an integral part of the Olympic Games from 776 BCE. After a decline during the Middle Ages, interest in athletics saw a resurgence during the Renaissance. The modern revival of track and field gained momentum in the 19th century, particularly in England and the United States, with schools and universities playing a key role in standardizing rules for various events.</p>
            <p>The establishment of governing bodies, such as the NCAA in 1906 and the IAAF (now World Athletics) in 1912, contributed to the sport's organization and internationalization. Track and field became a fundamental component of the modern Olympic Games since their revival in 1896, with iconic athletes like Jesse Owens and Usain Bolt leaving indelible marks on the sport. The 20th century witnessed continuous evolution, technological advancements, and record-breaking performances, solidifying track and field as a globally celebrated and widely participated-in sport, encompassing a diverse range of events from sprints and distance races to jumps, throws, and multi-event competitions. Today, it remains a cornerstone of the Olympic Movement and a sport with a rich legacy of athleticism and achievement.</p>

            <h3>About Track and Field</h3>
            <p>Track and field boasts a storied history rooted in ancient Greece, where it formed an integral part of the Olympic Games dating back to 776 BCE. Following a decline during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance witnessed a resurgence of interest in athletics, setting the stage for the sport's modern revival in the 19th century. England and the United States played pivotal roles during this period, with schools and universities becoming key contributors to the standardization of rules for various track and field events.</p>
            <p>The 19th century also saw the formation of crucial governing bodies, such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1906 and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now known as World Athletics, in 1912. These organizations played vital roles in organizing and promoting the sport, leading to its widespread international appeal. Track and field's prominence further solidified with its continued inclusion in the modern Olympic Games since 1896. Iconic athletes like Jesse Owens, who achieved unprecedented success in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and Usain Bolt, who set world records in the 21st century, have contributed to the sport's enduring legacy.</p>
            <p>In the 20th century, track and field underwent constant evolution, marked by technological advancements and the shattering of numerous records. The sport encompasses a diverse array of events, including sprints, middle-distance and long-distance races, hurdles, jumps, throws, and multi-event competitions like the decathlon and heptathlon. Today, track and field stands as a globally celebrated sport, continuing its role as a cornerstone of the Olympic Movement and a testament to human athleticism and achievement.</p>

                <h2 id="sec-header">Steve Harrington</h2>
                Steve is introduced as a high school student who initially comes across as a typical popular and somewhat arrogant teenager. He is dating Nancy Wheeler at the beginning of the series and is portrayed as a character who cares a lot about his social status. As the series progresses, Steve's character undergoes significant development. He starts as a self-absorbed character but gradually matures and becomes more responsible. He befriends Dustin Henderson, one of the young boys in the show, and becomes a fatherly figure and protector to the group of kids who are battling supernatural threats from the Upside Down. Steve's character becomes a fan-favorite due to his growth, his humorous one-liners, and his willingness to fight alongside the kids against the various creatures and mysteries of the show. He transforms from a stereotypical high school "bad boy" into a beloved character who shows genuine care for his friends and is willing to take risks to protect them.
